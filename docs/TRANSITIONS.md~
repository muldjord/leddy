## Scene transitions
There are two types of rendering formats in Leddy. One of them is scene transitions. A scene transition is an animation or effect Leddy uses to smoothly move from one scene to the next.

The format of the transitions and even the implementation is still be worked out, so expect some of this to not yet be implemented. For now this is more like a brain-storming page for myself.

Transitions will be very simple to create and use. It will use 1 PNG file per transition. And all information needed will be in the filename and the containd 16x16 sprite sheet.

The filename can define a framerate for the transition by setting it as a numeric after a dash in the filename. Here's an example:
```
name_of_transition-30.png
```
This will create a transition internally in Leddy which is called `name_of_transition` and it will run at approximately 30 frames per second.
