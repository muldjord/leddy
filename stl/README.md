# STL files
The original idea of using a IKEA Ribba frame as a foundation for mounting the Ubercorn LED matrix was conceived by John McCabe. You can check out his original project [here](https://johnmccabe.net/technology/projects/ubercorn-gameframe-pt1).

STL files contain the models used when 3D printing the parts needed to fit and fix the Ubercorn LED matrix in the Ribba frame.

I used John's mounting matrix as is. I slightly improved the corner spacers to fix the Ubercorn completely in place, ensuring that all of the LED's are centered within the matrix frame. I then, with a colleague of mine, designed a semi-transparent diffuser that fits snuggly into the mounting matrix. All of the files can be downloaded from here. The diffuser must be printed in semi-transparent PLA. The mounting matrix and spacers should be printed in black PLA.
